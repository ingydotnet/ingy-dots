These are some Unix dot files that I use. They are for public consumption but not generally useful to everyone.

I use this simple program to install my dot files: https://github.com/ingydotnet/...

I keep my general dot file base here: https://github.com/ingydotnet/dotdotdot

I also have a repo of my private dot files, but I keep those in a secret place. :)
